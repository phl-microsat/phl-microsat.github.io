                            <h1>General Information Questions</h1>
<h3>1. What is Diwata-I?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 is the Philippine's first microsatellite, which has been built to undertake scientific earth observation missions related to weather observation, environmental monitoring and disaster risk management. It is a 50-kg satellite equipped with four optical payloads in the visible to near infrared region that enable the aforementioned science missions. For more information about the satellite's bus and payload systems, please refer to "Diwata-1" in this website.</p>
<h3>2. What type of satellite is DIWATA-1 and what kind of orbit will it have?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 falls under the microsatellite category in terms of size (approx. 50 cm linear dimension) and weight (10-100 kg). In terms of use, it is intended as an earth observation satellite. Following a similar orbit as the International Space Station (ISS), it will fly at an altitude of 400-420 km and inclination of 51˚. With this orbit, DIWATA-1 is expected to pass over the country for an average of  four times a day with around  6 minutes of communication time.</p>
<h3>3. How is it different from weather and telecommunication satellites?</h3>
<p>Diwata-1 differs greatly from weather satellites for one, it occupies a Low Earth Orbit (400km) and is non-geostationary. Therefore, meteorological events such as typhoons cannot be monitored in real time. Also, weather satellites are much larger, which enables them to carry more capable and sophisticated sensors. Diwata-1 carries optical payloads for earth observation rather than communication payloads (transponders, amplifiers, etc) so it cannot be used for telecommunications.</p>
<h3>4. Who built DIWATA-1? Where was it developed?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 was built by Filipino engineering and science researchers who were sent to Tohoku University and Hokkaido University in Japan in collaboration with Japanese professors and experts and in close coordination with a local team of experts from the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) and the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI). Its development was fully funded by the Philippine government through the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and the University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>
<h3>5. When, where and how will DIWATA-1 be launched into space?</h3>
<p>Diwata-1 will be brought from Japan to the U.S., where the rocket that will carry it to space will be launched. The rocket will bring Diwata-1 to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the resupply mission to be done through a private contactor's launch manifest. The rocket launch is scheduled during the first quarter of 2016 but, as rocket launches typically go, is subject to delays due to various factors such as weather conditions, technical issues, etc. Once in the ISS, it will be housed in the KIBO Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), which will release Diwata-1 into space through its Japan Small Satellite (JSS) deployer. The release is targeted within the first half of 2016.</p>
<h3>6. Isn't AGILA the first Philippine satellite?</h3>
<p>AGILA is the first Filipino owned satellite acquired by Mabuhay Satellite Corporation to provide commercial telecommunication services. DIWATA-1 is Philippines' first earth observation satellite designed, developed and built by Filipino engineers and scientists, and fully-funded by the Philippine government.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Mission and Payload</h1>
<h3>1. What is the mission of DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>The science mission priorities of Diwata - 1 includes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assessment of the extent of disaster using the target pointing capability of Diwata-1. The target pointing capability of Diwata-1 would enable us to observe disaster affected areas at both nadir and off-nadir view. Acquiring these critical observations soon after disaster will aid in implementing fast disaster response and right resource allocation. With Diwata-1, further observations can be done for monitoring rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Diwata-1’s High Precision Telescope can provide images at 3 m resolution which can be useful for observing surface features needed for various applications: agriculture, forestry, urban management, disaster response and natural and cultural heritage preservation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Diwata-1’s Spaceborne Multispectral Imager with Liquid Crystal Tuning Filter can capture images at different wavelengths.  With Diwata-1’s selective multispectral capability, scientists can develop algorithms to derive geophysical parameters needed for the following applications: agriculture, forestry and fisheries. 4. Diwata 1’s Wide Field Camera can provide images of cloud patterns and distribution as well as weather disturbances such as tropical cyclones. With a coverage area of 180 x 134 degrees, these information can be input to algorithms that can be useful for weather observation and forecasting.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. What are the payload instruments onboard DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1's three scientific optical payloads are: (1) High Precision Telescope (HPT) with a 3m resolution in R/G/B and NIR bands, (2) Spaceborne Multispectral Imager (SMI) with Liquid Tunable Filter (LCTF), and (3) Wide Field Camera (WFC) with panchromatic CCD. In addition to these, it also carries a Middle Field Camera (MFC) as an engineering payload. For detailed specifications of these payloads, please refer to "Diwata-1" in this website.</p>
<h3>3. What are the capabilities and targetted applications of each payload?</h3>
<p>The HPT will be mainly used for taking high-resolution images of disaster-struck areas, as well as built and natural environments. The SMI, through its multispectral observation capability, can be used to support several science applications such as assessment of agricultural resources, forests and fisheries. The WFC can be used for taking images of cloud pattern distribution and large-scale observation of weather phenomenon. Specific examples of the use of DIWATA-1 images include large-scale assessment of vegetation health, forest cover loss, forest fire detection, delineation of aquaculture boundaries and monitoring of forest and marine protected areas .</p>
<h3>4. Will the PHL-Microsat Program help address our dependence on other existing satellites for imagery data used for weather forecasting, resource monitoring and other remote sensing applications?</h3>
<p>In order to support various scientific earth observation applications, it is often necessary to have access to different kinds of satellite images, such as radar, optical, infrared, etc. The images to be obtained from Diwata-1 are intended to augment and complement the images that the country currently accesses from other satellites. Diwata-1, however, offers the important benefit of providing on-demand access to an earth observation satellite that we can fully control, leading to faster turnaround time for measurements. It is also important to note that the development of Diwata-1, as one of the components of the PHL-MICROSAT program, addresses the need to develop our capability in satellite technology development, which can only be obtained through deep, intensive hands-on study. The program enables us to undertake relevant research towards locally developing the satellite sub-systems and sensors that are tailored to our future needs. These capacity-building activities are necessary and important steps towards achieving our collective aspiration for technology self-reliance.</p>
<h3>5. What is the expected life span of DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 is expected to have a maximum lifespan of about 18 months.</p>
<h3>6. What are the risks in launching DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>All spacecraft and satellites are exposed to hazards before, during and after the launch. Experts who will handle pre-launch preparations of DIWATA-1 take into consideration all these hazards and tailor satellite risk management solutions. Even when the launch is successfully finished, there are still risks of damage, malfunction or total loss within the microsatellite's operational life.</p>
<hr>
<h1>DATA ACCESS and GRS Questions</h1>
<h3>1. How do we communicate with the satellite?</h3>
<p>The satellite will be operated from the Gound Receiving Station to be housed in the Philippine Earth Data Resource Observation (PEDRO) Center.</p>
<h3>2. After the launch, how long will it take before DIWATA-1 can deliver usable images?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 is intended to capture and send images to the GRS immediately after its release into space. However, usable images will only be available at least one (1) month from the release in order to give time for post-launch calibration of the sensors and other technical self-check activities. It is important to note that data downloaded from the sensors in Diwata-1 need to be post-processed by the research team before useful images can be obtained.</p>
<h3>3. How frequent can we download images from DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 is set to pass over the Philippines four times per day with around six minutes of communication time in each pass. With a downlink speed of 2.4 Mbps at X-band, the satellite is estimated to provide up to 40 images per day. The target pointing capability of DIWATA-1 allow off-nadir acquisition of image for special tasking missions like tropical storm monitoring.</p>
<h3>4. Are the images from DIWATA accessible to all?</h3>
<p>Images from DIWATA-1 are intended to be freely available on a cc/open data commons license. Details of the data access mechanisms and utilization are still being finalized.</p>
<h3>5. What are the data products that DIWATA-1 can provide?</h3>
<p>Examples of available data products include NDVI and other vegetation indices maps, chlorophyll-a maps, surface reflectance, top of atmosphere reflectance and cloud masks. Please continue to watch this site for further developments on this front.</p>

<h1>BEYOND PHL-Microsat Program</h1>
<h3>1. What's next for the PHL-Microsat Program?</h3>
<p>The PHL-Microsat Program serves as the country's first step in capacity building for space technology development . A second microsatellite, DIWATA-2, will be developed employing the experience gained by the Filipino engineering and science researchers from DIWATA-1. Aside from producing another satellite with new capabilities towards supporting new science missions,  the development of DIWATA-2 will further enhance the expertise of our Filipino engineers and scientists in microsatellite bus development, payload design, mission analysis and other microsatellite technologies. This will be supported by the establishment of the country's Microsatellite Research and Instructional Facility (MRIF) in the University of the Philippines Diliman and the eventual establishment of a national space agency for the Philippines. The MRIF will be our venue for engaging  other local universities and research institutions towards expanding the space technology development in the country.</p>
<h3>2.  How does the program contribute to the development of space technology in the country?</h3>
<p>By having an academic or University base for the program, the initial efforts of the Philippine government in space technology development will be better sustained through the constant influx of young talent, active linkages with government insitutions and local industry and the vibrant partnerships with overseas collaborating and cooperating institutions. The program can exploit existing linkages between the Univertsity and local industry, for example, to translate the systems engineering expertise and discipline acquired from building satellite technologies into enabling new and enhancing current manufacturing and testing services. These synergies available at the University enable the PHL-MICROSAT program to provide valuable inputs in the establishment a national space agency and the crafting of a relevant and sustainable space technology development agenda for the Filipino people.</p>
