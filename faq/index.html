                            <h1>General Information Questions</h1>
<h3>What is Diwata-I?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 is the Philippine's first earth observation satellite which is  primarily built to aid and assess in disaster management, agricultural and aquatic resource, and weather disturbances in the Philippines. It is a 50-kg satellite equipped with four optical payloads in the visible to near infrared region. For more information about the satellite's bus and payload systems, please refer to "Diwata-1" in this website.</p>
<h3>What type of satellite is DIWATA-1 and what kind of orbit will it have?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 falls under the microsatellite category (10-100 kg) in terms of size (50  kg). In terms of use, it is intended as an earth observation satellite. Following the same orbit as the International Space Station (ISS), it will fly at an altitude of 400-420 km and inclination of 51Ëš. With this orbit, DIWATA-1 is expected to pass over the country for an average of  four times a day with around  6 minutes of communication time.</p>
<h3>How is it different from weather and telecommunication satellites?</h3>
<p>Diwata-1 differs greatly from weather satellites for one, its Low Earth Orbit (400km). It is non-geostationary thus, meteorological events such as typhoons cannot be monitored in real time. Also, weather satellites are much larger, which enables them to carry more capable and sophisticated sensors. Diwata-1 carries optical payloads for earth observation rather than communication payloads (transponders, amplifiers, etc) so it cannot be used for telecommunications.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Mission and Payload</h1>
<h3>What is the mission of DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1  will be launched to address primarily science and social applications. It will be used for the inventory of urban and rural devolopment, natural and cultural heritage sites; for protection, planning, and management of water resources, fisheries and vegetation.</p>
<h3>What are the payload instruments onboard DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1's three scientific optical payloads are: (1) High Precision Telescope (HPT) with a 3m resolution in R/G/B and NIR bands, (2) Spaceborne Multispectral Imager (SMI) with Liquid Tunable Filter (LCTF), and (3) Wide Field Camera (WFC) with panchromatic CCD. In addition to these, it also carries a Middle Field Camera (MFC) as an engineering payload. For detailed specifications of these payloads, please refer to "Diwata-1" in this website.</p>
<h3>What are the capabilities and targetted applications of each payload?</h3>
<p>The HPT will be mainly used for taking high-resolution images of disaster-struck areas. The SMI can be used for several science applications such as agriculture and fisheries. The WFC can be used for taking images of cloud pattern distribution and large-scale observation of weather phenomenon. In general, DIWATA-1 images can be used for large-scale assessment of vegetation health, forest loss and forest fire detection, delineation of aquaculture boundaries and assessment of forest and marine protected areas.</p>
<h3>Is DIWATA-1 intended for military and security applications?</h3>
<p>No. The satellite is not designed for military applications.</p>
<h3>Will the PHL-Microsat Program help address our dependence on foreign  commercial satellites for imagery data used for weather forecasting, resource monitoring and other remote sensing applications?</h3>
<p>In order to cater various applications such as mentioned, we need to have access to different kinds of satellite images (radar, optical, infrared, etc.). Different satellites have different payloads which are targetted for certain applications. In other words, the specifications of DIWATA-1's optical payloads (e.g., as spatial resolution, spectral resolution, spectral range, field of view, etc.) determine a range of applications that can be addressed (please see DIWATA-1 payload specifications and data products in this website). Although the images from DIWATA-1 alone cannot meet all our needs, these augment the images that we have been already buying. More importantly, this program addresses the need to develop our capacity in satellite technology, which can only be obtained through deep, intense study. It will allow us to study and locally develop sensors that are tailored for our needs. Furthermore, building a satellite that is fully controlled by our government can provide much faster turnaround time for observations.</p>
<h3>What is the expected life span of DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>DIWATA-1 is expected to have a maximum lifespan of about 18 months.</p>
<h3>What are the risks in launching DIWATA-1?</h3>
<p>All spacecrafts and satellites are exposed to hazards before, during and after the launch. Experts who will handle pre-launch preparations of DIWATA-1 take into consideration all these hazards and tailor satellite risk management solutions. Even when the launch is successfully finished, there are still risks of damage, malfunction or total loss during the microsatellite's operational life.</p>
