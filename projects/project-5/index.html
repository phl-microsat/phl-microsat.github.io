                <h1>Project 5 - Remote Sensing Product Development for the Philippine Microsatellite Program</h1>
<p><strong>Leader/Gender:</strong> Dr. Gay Jane Perez</p>
<p><strong>Agency/Address:</strong>  Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology, University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City, 1101 PHILIPPINES</p>
<p><strong>Telephone/Fax/Email:</strong> 981-8500 local 3945</p>
<hr>
<h1>Cooperating Agencies:</h1>
<p>DOST PCIIEERD, DOST ASTI, UP DGE, UP EEEI, UP NIP, Tohoku University, Hokkaido University</p>
<hr>
<h1>Research and Development Station:</h1>
<p>Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology</p>
<hr>
<h1>Site of Implementation/Municipality/District/Province/Region:</h1>
<p>Philippines (nationwide)</p>
<hr>
<h1>Significance:</h1>
<p>Current trends in space research and development agencies and industries gradually place greater emphasis on redducing the costs for the development and operations of the satellites in orbit. Spacecraft costs were primarily derived from the satellite operations. In order to decrease mission costs, it has become necessary to reduce operational costs, especially starting with the education and training of local engineers and researchers in the universities and colleges.</p>
<p>Through technical minimization that was unthinkable a few years ago, interest in micro-satellites has been increasing rapidly. The major advantage lies in the relatively fast and cheap development, which makes them a suitable platform for technology evaluation. Hence, they provide the ideal opportunity to test new systems in space within a short timeframe and low budget.</p>
<p>An archipelago such as the Philippines would benefit from a canopy-like coverage that such satellites can afford. Whether for remote sensing or telecommunications purposes, a satellite that is fully controlled by the government for educational, research and other services will enable flexibility and faster turnaround for scientific measurements and experimentation. In light of t regular typhhons and other natural calamities, providing on-demand and real-time access to remote sensing and high-resolution satellite imagery to facilitate risk management and disaster response fills a crucial void for the country.</p>
<p>The success of a microsatellite mission is also measured through the utilization and usefulness of the data it captures. Setting the science objectives at the early stage of the mission will ensure that the system (microsatellite) will be designed and engineered according to the requirements of end-users. This will also allow other members of the scientific community with relevant expertise to become member of the science team and contribute to the development of high quality satellite-derived products. The algorithms that will be used for product development will be tested using data from previous microsatellite missions.  This, together with a collection of spectral signatures from various materials, will constitute the basis for data calibration and validation.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Objectives:</h1>
<p>The objectives of the project are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>To form a science team that will ensure the integrity and maximize the utility of data obtained from the microsatellite</li>
<li>To process data from previous microsatellite missions: RISING-2 and UNIFORM</li>
<li>To build spectral library of high-quality data to be used for ground-truthing and algorithm development</li>
<li>To produce georeferenced (Level 1a) and calibrated radiances (Level 1b) products</li>
<li>To build the capacity on processing microsatellite data</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1>Review of Related Literature:</h1>
<p>Significant missions in space were initially carried out using large satellites.  Such missions would usually have several different purposes, requiring the use of large instruments or communication payloads with a higher power requirement. Advances in microelectronics in the 1970s and the need for highly focused missions gave rise to the construction of smaller and lighter satellites. Microsatellites in particular, are defined as those whose mass fall within 10 to 100 kg, compared to the &gt;2500kg objects that wereususally sent to space. These man-made objects become a cheaper alternative for niche missions, and can be built in shorter span of time.</p>

<h1>Methodology:</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Formation of science team and objective setting Science Team meetings and workshop (to be convened by DOST-PCIEERD). The prospective end users/stakeholders/beneficiaries will be involved in the program through the science team meetings (workshops) and announcement of opportunities (call for proposal). For the first workshop, which will happen alongside the mission definition phase, the micro satellite program (including its capability, payload options, schedule and current team composition) will be introduced. The participants will also be consulted on the preferred data/data products, its format and mode of distribution. The main output of the workshop is to define the science mission and objectives. Shortly after the workshop, an announcement of opportunities must be made to solicit proposals on 1) payload design and development and 2) algorithm and science product development. Successful proponents will constitute the science team together with the leaders of project components 1-5. Succeeding workshops/ science team meetings will be the venue to review the progress of the mission/program and updates from science team members. Payloads will be determined in line with the identified science mission and objectives.</p>

<li><p>Remote sensing product development. Access and process data from RISING-2 and UNIFORM through our own ground receiving station and/or data feed from university partners in Japan</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect and process spectral signature of various surfaces at different seasons</li>
<li>Develop algorithm to derive georeferenced and calibrated radiances. Data from microsatellite will be processed to a form (Level 1) that can readily be used to develop science data products (Level 2, e.g. vegetation indices, ocean color, temperature). A science team member can specialize on one type of science data products (e.g. land products), develop the algorithm and produce the corresponding algorithm theoretical basis </li>
