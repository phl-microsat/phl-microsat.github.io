<h2>Cooperating Agencies:</h2>
<p>UP, PAGASA</p>
<hr>
<h2>Research and Development Station:</h2>
<p>Advanced Science and Technology Institute, ASTI Bldg., Technology Park, C.P. Garcia Ave., U.P. Diliman, Quezon City</p>
<hr>
<h2>Site of Implementation:</h2>
<p>Ground Receiving Station: Subic, Zambales</p>
<hr>
<h2>Sector/Commodity:</h2>
<p>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Electronics</p>
<hr>
<h2>Significance:</h2>
<p>A ground receiving station is a significant sub-system of the Philippine Microsatellite Program. It allows space borne images taken by an orbiting microsatellite to be transmitted to earth for use in various scientific and civilian applications. Likewise, it is used to control and transmit commands from the ground to the microsatellite so that it can carry out its mission effectively. To support the ground receiving station, an archiving and distribution facility will be leveraged to deliver imagery to end users.</p>
<p>This component project is significant because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will foster capability building to control, receive, and process microsatellite imagery;</li>
<li>it will facilitate distribution and storage of satellite imagery;</li>
<li>it can provide immediate returns even before the launch of the Philippine microsatellite by receiving images from other microsatellites, i.e. those that are covered by an agreement and are compatible with the ground system, thereby building up an archive of images that can already be used by local scientists and researchers. In addition, receiving imagery from other microsatellites also serves as a testbed to gauge the effectiveness of the system.</li>
<li>it can serve as a back up station, in case other ground receiving facility/ies is/are down, that can receive imagery and data in behalf of a partner nation that operates a similar microsatellite. Once received, the data can be forwarded via the Internet. This fosters cooperation between nations operating microsatellites wherein the ground receiving station in each nation can back up each other in case of down times. </li>
</ul>
<p>The ground station is proposed to be colocated with the PEDRO project in a satellite farm in Subic. This will allow centralized management, monitoring and maintenance by a dedicated team.</p>
<p>To complement the ground receiving station and in view of the research interests of ASTI, the institute will also engage in capability building and training related to telemetry, tracking and control (TT&amp;C), satellite bus design and development, mission planning, and system integration and tests (ex. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests which can be done at the EPDC). These complementary activities are also indicated in the program proposal.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<p>The project aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a facility for the Ground Receiving Station to receive imagery from microsatellites             </li>
<li>Develop the capacity to control, receive and process microsatellite imagery by training personnel to manage, operate and maintain the ground receiving station;</li>
<li>Facilitate archiving and distribution of satellite imagery to end-users</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Review of Related Literature:</h2>
<p>The PEDRO Project</p>
<p>The Philippine Earth Data Resource and Observation (PEDRO) Center is a Multi-Mission Ground Receiving Station (MMGS) that was proposed and subsequently approved for funding by the DOST. IT is a multi-sensor remote sensing ground station solution tha enables direct access to a broad range of optical (high-resolution, multispectral) and radar (cloud-penetrating, day-night-imaging) satellite data missions that are capable of meeting the application needs of the government and the public in general. This project calls for the establishment of a system and infrastructure to securely receive, process, exploit and distribute spaceborne imagery and derive information from the supported remote sensing satellites. The images will provide coverage opportunities for various applications such as natural resource management, environmental monitoring, pollution control, energy exploration, intelligence, urban development monitoring, and emergency response management.</p>
<p>PEDRO shall have the capability to downlink data from two satellite sensors: 1) an optical multispectral sensor and 2) a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor. Each sensor has its own acquisition capability and strategy. Below is a summary of the proposed satellite remote sensing systems and their characteristics.</p>
<p>The project has a 2 year duration with the ground receiving station located in Subic. The proposed site is appropriate for the ground station since it once hosted a satellite farm. Likewise, PEDRO will leverage exisiting DOST projects such as the ICTO data center that will be established in Subic, and the CoARE project for data processing and archiving.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Scientific Basis/Theoretical Framework</h2>
<p>The Ground Receiving Station, which can be mounted on a roof, will receive images and other data from the Philippine microsatellite. In addition, it can receive images from other microsatellites that are covered by an agreement.  The Ground Receiving Station can also send commands to the microsatellite to enable it to carry out its mission effectively.</p>
<p>Once the data has been received, the data will be processed, archived, and eventually distributed via the Internet to end users such as academicians, scientists, and researchers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Methodology:</h2>
<p>The major activities that encompass the proposed project are as follows:</p>
<p>a)    Consultation with Japanese experts regarding the requirements and specifications of the ground receiving station
b)    Preparing the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the ground receiving station
c)    Procurement
d)    Installation
e)    Parallel to procurement and installation, capacity building will be conducted, mainly through training, to educate the team on operation, maintenance and understanding how the system works which in turn can spur local content and innovation for the ground system. 
f)    Provide project documentation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Expected Output:</h2>
<p>Year 1</p>
<ul>
<li>Terms of Reference and Specifications for the Ground Receiving Station</li>
</ul>
<p>Year 2</p>
<ul>
<li>Installation of an operational ground receiving station that can effectively receive space-•    borne imagery</li>
<li>Trained personnel that can operate and maintain the system</li>
</ul>
<p>Year 3 and 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution and Archiving of satellite imagery from the operation of the Ground Receiving Station</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Target Beneficiaries:</h2>
<p>The target beneficiaries for this project are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists and Researchers that are in need of satellite imagery to enchance their research activities which will eventually redound to the public as societal benefits</li>
<li>Civilian organizations, such as DRMMCs and other organizations that will benefit from the microsatellite's mission </li>
<li>DOST through space S&amp;T capability building and manpower training</li>
</ul>
